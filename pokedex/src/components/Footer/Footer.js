 * PureComponent is exactly the same as Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate method for you. 
 * When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. 
 * Component on the other hand wonâ€™t compare current props and state to next out of the box. 
 * Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.
